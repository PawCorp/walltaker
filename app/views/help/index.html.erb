  <h3>Getting started</h3>
  <p>
    Thanks for being willing to give Walltaker a try! It's pretty easy to get started, but it might seem a bit weird at
    first since there's some hoops we have to jump thru to be able to update your wallpaper.
  </p>

  <h4 id="getting-started-log-in">0. Log in</h4>
  <div>
    <p>
      Firstly, <strong>you will need an account.</strong> You can make an account by pressing the
      <span class="mock-link">Sign Up</span> link in the top-right-hand side of the screen, in the header. Once you have
      an account (which should only take 1 minute) return to this page. You must be logged in to continue.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h4 id="getting-started-make-a-link">1. Your First Link</h4>
  <div>
    <p>
      Now that you have an account, you should make a
      <strong>
        <ion-icon name="document"></ion-icon>
        Link.
      </strong>
      The core "thing" in Walltaker is links. They are the sharable page that you can post on social media
      or give to friends that lets them change your wallpaper. In order to create your own link:
    </p>
    <ul class="task-list">
      <li>
        Click
        <div class="mock-link">Links</div>
        in the header.
        <%= image_tag '/help/header-links-location.png' %>
      </li>
      <li>
        ...then click
        <div class="mock-button">New Link</div>
        <%= image_tag '/help/new-link-button-location.png' %>
      </li>
      <li>
        ...then confire your new link.

        <p>
          <strong>There are 6 options</strong> to change here that affect who can set your wallpaper, and what
          restrictions they have to work within. Set these as you see fit, using the key below to explain what each
          option does.
        </p>
        <%= image_tag '/help/new-link-form.png', class: 'small' %>

        <div class="accordion" data-controller="accordion">
          <button class="accordion__trigger" data-action="click->accordion#toggle" aria-controls="options-explanation">
            <ion-icon name="expand"></ion-icon>
            Toggle options explanation
          </button>
          <div class="accordion__content" data-accordion-target="content" id="options-explanation" aria-label="Explanation of options shown in Link Form">
            <h5>#1 Expires</h5>
            <p>
              This is the date at which this link will not accept more wallpaper changes. Clicking
              it will open a date picker. You could use this for example if you want to use walltaker for a full
              weekend,
              but
              want it to stop on monday for work.
            </p>

            <h5>#2 Never Expires</h5>
            <p>
              Ensures that the link will never expire, and people you allow to set the link will be able to do so until
              you
              delete it.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <strong>
                <ion-icon name="checkbox-outline"></ion-icon>
                When checked,</strong>
              this link will never expire, and the #1 Expires option will be ignored.<br/>
              <strong>
                <ion-icon name="square-outline"></ion-icon>
                When unchecked,</strong>
              this link will expire at the date indicated by the #1 Expires option.
            </blockquote>

            <h5>#3 Friends Only</h5>
            <p>
              This restricts who can set wallpapers on this link.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <strong>

              ONLY people you have accepted friend requests with will be able to see and set your wallpaper.<br/>
              <strong>
                <ion-icon name="square-outline"></ion-icon>
                When unchecked,</strong>
              ANYONE (including anon users) will be able to see and set your wallpaper.
            </blockquote>

            <h5>#4 Blacklist</h5>
            <p>
              A list of E621 tags that must NOT appear on wallpapers people submit.
              <strong>Tags are separated by spaces or commas,</strong> and cannot be special tags. (such as rating:e)
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <strong>female feral feline</strong> will prevent any posts with females presenting characters, feral
              characters, or felines.<br/>
              <strong>male/male group_sex solo</strong> will mean you only get extremely boring, straight, 1-on-1 porn.
              You
              weirdo.
            </blockquote>

            <h5>#5 Terms</h5>
            <p>
              Your link terms are simply an area to express what you'd like to see as wallpapers more generally. Nothing
              here
              is enforced, it's just a text field for you to leave a note that appears on the link. I suggest you
              outline
              what
              things turn you on here.
            </p>

            <h5>#6 Theme Tag</h5>
            <p>
              Theme tags are special! This is a way to enforce all wallpapers submitted to this link to be tagged with a
              single, specific tag of your choosing. Use this when you're looking for something specific, like a
              specific
              species or sex act. You're horny, you'll come up with something fun.
              <strong>Be careful about how you type your tag in here.</strong> If you misspell this theme tag, no one
              will
              be
              able to submit anything until you remove it or correct the spelling. Confirm spelling on E621 if you have
              to.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <strong>
                <ion-icon name="checkmark-outline"></ion-icon>
                loimu_(character)</strong> all posts will feature Loimu ðŸ¦Œ. Any other characters are blocked.<br/>
              <strong>
                <ion-icon name="hand-left-outline"></ion-icon>
                pokeemon</strong> a missspelled tag! No one will be able to submit anything.<br/>
              <strong>
                <ion-icon name="hand-left-outline"></ion-icon>
                tits</strong> an alias tag! While this works in e621 search, the real tag is "breasts", so this is the
              same
              as misspelling a tag.

    <p>
      Congratulations! You should have a fresh link ready to share with the world. However, it currently doesn't change
      the wallpaper on anything. This is because, as simply a website, Walltaker can not change your wallpaper for you.
      To allow us to do this,
      <strong>we need a Walltaker Client, which is an app you can install on which ever devices you'd
        like to get wallpaper updates on.</strong> It will silently check your link every 10 seconds, and update your
      wallpaper if
      there's a new one, automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can download a client for which ever device you'd like to use. Follow the instructions for each one for how to
      install it, then return to this tutorial.

              Some clients have fancier settings that you can change. They normally store these settings in a text
              configuration file called <code>walltaker.toml</code>. If you're using a client that prefers you use a
              .toml file, click the

            <p>
              Your client pinged this link at least once, but gave up! This could be due to a number of things:
            <ul>
              <li>Did your client crash?</li>
              <li>Some phone operating systems kill background apps, this can sometimes affect clients. Refer to client

      Now it's time to share your link! This couldn't be easier. Just copy and paste the URL from your browser. it
      should look like <code>https://walltaker.joi.how/links/420</code> where the last number is your link ID.
      <strong>
        Share this with anyone you want! This is where people edit your wallpaper.

  <h3>I got a wallpaper I don't like.</h3>
  <p>
    Walltaker is an app for letting others change your wallpaper, <strong>without</strong> your
    approval. While I provide as many tools as possible to ensure you only get wallpapers you like, know that the point
    of this app is to be <strong>out of control</strong> to some extent. Here are some tips to use walltaker's filtering
    features to their fullest:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Add people you trust as friends,</strong> this allows you to use
      <ion-icon name="document-lock"></ion-icon>
      friends-only links, which stops anon spam. This is by far the most effective route.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Use a theme tag.</strong> A theme tag allows you to force a tag to be present on wallpapers people pick
      for you. This can normally be good at filtering out things like genitalia (gay) you don't want to see or forcing a
      specific sexuality. (male/female)
    </li>
    <li><strong>Fill out your blacklist honestly.</strong> If you don't like <em>most</em> foot-fetish art, then it
      should be in your
      blacklist, even if there's some art you do like. People don't read your link terms enough to understand nuance.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Be clear in your terms.</strong> A lot of bad wallpapers are simply mistakes. Use as few words as
      possible to express
      what you want.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    As always, if you think you're being harassed, contact an admin on the discord (See link in the header) who can
    look into it for you, and IP ban an anon user if they're trying to be malicious.
  </p>
